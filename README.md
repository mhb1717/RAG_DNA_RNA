## Quick Start

### Step 1: Generate Data Features
Navigate to the `data` folder and use the **FASTA** file to generate additional data features saved in the `dataset` folder.

**Example usage:**
```bash
python get_ProtTrans.py -in "Your FASTA file folder" -out "The destination folder of your output"
python get_tape.py -in "Your FASTA file folder" -out "The destination folder of your output"
python get_esm.py "Pretrained model of ESM" "Your FASTA file folder" "The destination folder of your output" --repr_layers 33 --include per_tok
python get_ProstT5.py -in "Your FASTA file folder" -out "The destination folder of your output"
```  <!-- ðŸ‘ˆ This closes the gray code block properly -->

### Step 2: Create a Multi-Scale or Sliding Window Feature Set
Run the `get_dataset.py` script:
```bash
python get_dataset.py -in "path of features" -label "path of labels" -out "path of output features set" -w 7 -dt ".prottrans"
